Welcome to Face Finder...... An app that utilizes the awesome AI face detection API by Clarifai!

This project was built in order to delve deeper into the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence models, and to see how the API's handle client requests and how they can be integrated and utilized by a multitude of projects.

## Clarifai: Face Detection API

Clarifai's Machine Learning face detection API has the ability to detect human faces in provided URL's of images and videos, with an accuracy level of 99.97%.... That's ridiculously impressive! It then returns the results of these requests displayed in bounding boxes overlayed on the original file. The following gif shows the application at work.

Application in use on an image which includes a face:
